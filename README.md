# SpeedConnect

A fast-paced, real-time word connections game where players race against time to identify groups of related words. Inspired by the popular NYT Connections puzzle, SpeedConnect adds competitive multiplayer elements and AI-generated content for when one puzzle a day is not enough.

## Game Overview

Players are presented with a grid of 16 words and must identify four groups of four related words. Each group has a specific theme or connection that links the words together. The challenge lies in finding these connections while racing against a 5-minute timer and competing with other players.
